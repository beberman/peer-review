# peer-review

This is a basic application for doing peer review in team projects. The survey tools that are out there were to complex or to slow in their experience. 
This application just uses a simple google sheet which controls the questions, students, team assignments to the teams. Results are then collected
to a ratings and comments tab on the sheet.   

The code works as intended but lacks many features and robustness issues. It does not create the tabs if they are missing. It doesn't check that the required tabs are
in place.

Also to do would be an admin interface that would make it easier to set the list of students and then do the calculations on changes in grades based on peer comments.
